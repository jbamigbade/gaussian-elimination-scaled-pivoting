# Gaussian Elimination with Scaled Partial Pivoting (Octave)

This project demonstrates the solution of systems of linear equations using **Gaussian elimination with scaled partial pivoting** implemented in **GNU Octave**. The solution process includes forward elimination, back substitution, and a comparison of numerical sensitivity when one matrix entry is perturbed.

## üß† What This Project Demonstrates

- **Scaled Partial Pivoting**: Reduces numerical instability during row reduction.
- **Sensitivity to Input**: Shows how a tiny change in the matrix can lead to significant changes in the solution ‚Äî a hallmark of ill-conditioned systems.
- **Scripted Output**: All results are saved to `output.txt` for documentation or grading.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run This Project Locally

If you downloaded this repository or cloned it from GitHub, follow these steps to run the Octave code:

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)

### 2. Download the Project
- Click the green **Code** button on this repo
- Select **Download ZIP**
- Extract the ZIP to a known folder, e.g.:


### 3. Open Octave and Navigate to the Folder
```octave
cd 'C:/OctaveProjects/gaussian-elimination'

4. Run the Main Script
TestSP
          This will:
          
          Execute Gaussian elimination with scaled partial pivoting.
          
          Print solutions for both the original and modified systems.
          
          Save results to output.txt in the same folder.

5. View the Output
      type output.txt
